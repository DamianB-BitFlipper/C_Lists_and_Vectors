A C library that implements doubly linked lists and dynamic arrays in a very easy fashion. This library uses preprocessor macros to make the code clean. This library contains mostly the same functionality as the C++ std::list and std::vector libraries, but this is in pure C!

An example file with the basic usage of the list and vector C library is included: example.c
